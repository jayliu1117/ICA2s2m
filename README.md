# ICA2s2m

All the work on ICA and understanding of ICA is based on the paper "Independent Component Analysis: Algorithms and Applications" published in 2000 by Hyv√§rinen and Oja.

While I was reading on ICA, I thought it would be a great idea to actually implement it with Python!
I am using two methods to implement ICA:
1. Gradient Ascent method - maximizing the estimated joint entropy of the unmixed sources
2. FastICA - minimizing the mutual information of the unmixed sources
